google-homepage

The objective of this project is to build a replica of the google.com homepage using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to develop my HTML and CSS skills while utilizing Google Chrome's developer tools to practice breaking down features from other websites and debugging my own code. When finished, the project should resemble Google's homepage as much as possible, minus the functionality of course.
